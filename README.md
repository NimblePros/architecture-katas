# NimblePros' Architecture Katas Repo

This repo contains katas that we create for our own use, beyond what's already there.

When you're focusing on [growing your coding career](https://youtube.com/live/T5gGq6E0bbc), katas are a way to keep those skills sharp!

While some repos have rules, we use these katas for various architectural considerations - from prioritizing architectural qualities to using practices such as diagramming, EventStorming, and domain storytelling. We have captured these ideas in our [presentation ideas](./presentation-ideas.md).

## Additional Repos

These are additional kata repos to know about:

- [Ted Neward's Architecture Katas](https://github.com/tedneward/ArchKatas) - used for [architecturalkatas.com](https://www.architecturalkatas.com/)
- [Ardalis' Kata Catalog](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog) - These are code katas rather than architectural katas. These are helpful for sharpening your coding skills.
