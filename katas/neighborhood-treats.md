# Neighborhood Treats

## Description

A data science team – The Sweet Surveyors – has been tasked with optimizing trick-or-treating routes for a group of young adventurers. The goal is to identify the neighborhoods with the highest density of houses offering treats, considering factors like candy quality, treat variety, and overall safety.

## Users

* Data Analysts (3-5): Collect and analyze data.
* Route Planners (2-4): Develop and optimize routing algorithms.
* Social Media Monitors (1-2): Monitor social media for real-time updates.
* Treat Quality Assessors (4-6): Evaluate treat quality based on neighborhood characteristics.

## Requirements

* Collect and analyze data on houses participating in trick-or-treating (addresses, treat offerings, house safety ratings).
* Develop and optimize routing algorithms to minimize travel time and maximize treat intake.
* Model treat quality based on neighborhood demographics and past observation.
* Estimate the potential treat volume for each neighborhood.
* Predict treat availability based on historical data and real-time social media reports.
* Manage treat risk – evaluating potential dangers such as crowded streets, aggressive trick-or-treaters, and blocked pathways.

## Potential Kata Challenges & Considerations

* Routing Algorithms: The core challenge – finding the best path through a complex network.
* Data Collection: Gathering information on houses and neighborhood characteristics.
* Treat Quality Assessment: A subjective element – modeling how treat quality varies.
* Real-time Information: Incorporating social media reports for up-to-the-minute data.
