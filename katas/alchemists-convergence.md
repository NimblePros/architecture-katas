# The Alchemist's Convergence

**A Spooky Distributed Systems Kata**

## Description

A secretive guild of alchemists - 'The Obsidian Circle' - has established a network of remote labs deep beneath the Blackwood Forest. They specialize in synthesizing potent elixirs and artifacts, and demand is peaking just before the annual 'Night of Convergence' - a period of heightened magical activity.

## Setting

A sprawling, gothic network of subterranean laboratories.

## Users

- **Master Alchemists (10-15):** Oversee labs, manage complex synthesis processes.
- **Apprentice Alchemists (50-75):** Execute synthesis processes, monitor equipment.
- **Logistics Coordinators (5-8):** Route finished elixirs to clients.
- **Quality Assurance Inspectors (10-15):** Test elixirs for potency and stability.
- **Researchers (3-5):** Investigate new ingredients and synthesis techniques.
- **Archivists (2-4):** Maintain a secure archive of research data and failed experiments (the 'Lost Grimoires' are notoriously unstable).

## Requirements

- Track the volatile ingredients used in elixir synthesis (e.g., Shadowroot, Dragon's Breath, Tears of the Moon).
- Manage the synthesis processes across multiple labs - ensuring stability and minimizing errors.
- Monitor the potency of the resulting elixirs, flagging potential instabilities.
- Route the finished elixirs to designated clients (powerful mages, collectors, etc.).
- Maintain a secure archive of research data and failed experiments (the 'Lost Grimoires' are notoriously unstable).
- Predict demand for specific elixirs based on historical data and the 'Night of Convergence' forecast.
- Detect and mitigate potential 'Convergence Anomalies' - unpredictable surges of magical energy that can corrupt elixirs and damage labs.

## Potential Kata Challenges & Considerations

- Distributed Systems Architecture: How to coordinate synthesis processes across multiple labs.
- Data Consistency: Maintaining accurate inventories of volatile ingredients.
- Fault Tolerance: Handling lab shutdowns due to Convergence Anomalies.
- Monitoring & Alerting: Setting up alerts for critical events (e.g., ingredient depletion, instability spikes).
- Security: Protecting the 'Lost Grimoires' from corruption.

## Notes for Facilitators:

- Start with a simple synthesis process to allow the team to focus on the core distributed system concepts.
- Introduce failure scenarios gradually, increasing the complexity as the team gains experience.
- Encourage creative problem-solving - embrace the “spooky” nature of the setting!
