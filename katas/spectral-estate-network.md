# Spectral Estate Network

 ## Description

A consortium of paranormal investigators – 'The Veiled Watchers' – operate a network of connected, magically-infused haunted houses. Each house is equipped with sensors and automated systems to capture spectral activity and create immersive experiences for clients.

## Setting

A sprawling network of Victorian-era mansions, interconnected by spectral pathways.

## Users

- Spectral Analysts (10-15): Monitor and analyze spectral data.
- Maintenance Technicians (40-60): Manage and maintain the houses and their systems.
- Client Experience Managers (5-8): Customize the immersive experiences for clients.
- Data Engineers (3-5): Develop and maintain the data infrastructure.
- Security Protocols (2-4): Protect the houses and their data.

## Requirements

- Monitor and record spectral activity (temperature drops, EMF spikes, audio anomalies, visual distortions).
- Manage and operate the automated effects within each house (lighting, sound, projections, spectral manifestations).
- Securely route client data (preferences, fear levels, session recordings).
- Ensure the structural integrity of each house—detect and mitigate potential collapses or supernatural breaches.
- Maintain a secure archive of recorded sessions and spectral data—protecting against unauthorized access.
- Predict client engagement and optimize the immersive experience.
- Detect and respond to potential 'spectral bleed'—uncontrolled surges of supernatural energy.

## Potential Kata Challenges & Considerations

- Distributed Systems Architecture: Coordinating systems across multiple houses.
- Data Consistency: Managing spectral data across the network.
- Fault Tolerance: Handling house failures due to spectral bleed.
- Monitoring & Alerting: Setting up alerts for critical events.
- Security: Protecting sensitive client data.

## Notes for Facilitators

- Start with a single house to simplify the initial setup.
- Introduce failure scenarios gradually.
- Encourage creative problem-solving.
