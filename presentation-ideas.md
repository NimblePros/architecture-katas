# Presentation Ideas

We have experienced architectural katas in a variety of workshop presentations. Ted Neward's katas have a [Rules](https://www.architecturalkatas.com/rules.html) section. We have also experienced other workshops at other events. So these are some ideas on presenting architectural kata workshops.

## Who's Needed

When running a kata, you need:

- A moderator
- People who want to sharpening their skills

This works best in groups of 3-5 people. If you have multiple groups, consider having `a` moderator for at least 2-3 groups, depending on what you want to practice.

## General Flow

This is a general order for presenting katas:

1. Introduce the exercise and the goals to be accomplished.
2. Get into groups.
3. Select a kata.
4. Practice!
5. Present findings to the large group. Allow for questions and answers.
6. (optional) Vote on findings. Maybe "Most Creative", "Most Cost Efficient", "Fewest Production Fires", etc.
7. Session recap and retrospective. What did they learn? What did they like? What didn't they like? What else would they have liked to do?

## Assigning Katas

This can go many ways:

- For a small group, work on 1 kata together.
  - Even in a small group, we like to do a "silent together" session (up to 10 minutes) at first so that people can read the kata and take it in. Let them be with their thoughts. This is a time to get your own understanding before collaborating with the group.
  - After the "silent together" session, then collaborate and capture all the ideas.
- Break into groups and tackle 1 kata, seeing how the groups may differ.
- To keep things interesting, break into groups and have each group choose a kata.
  - Randomly assign a kata.
  - Have them draw a kata from a jar of katas.
  - Have them look at the list of katas and choose one on their own.

## Architectural Skills to Practice

We use katas for a variety of architectural skills and practices, including:

- Prioritizing architectural qualities
- Talking through architectural style decisions
- Capturing decisions in decision records
- EventStorming
- Domain storytelling
- Diagramming
- Wireframing for UX discussions
